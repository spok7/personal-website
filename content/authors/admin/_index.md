I am Spok, and I inspire people by making robots!

When I got involved with my high school robotics team, I realized that robots are really cool! Since then, I've had the pleasure of sharing my passion as a lead of many tech groups and a teaching assistant at the University of Toronto, and later, while starting the campus' very own robotics club. In my later studies, I have become very excited about machine learning as well, and I am constantly looking for problems that would benefit from the intersection of these two fields.
