publication_short: "CNN Indoor Navigation"

abstract: In this paper we propose a number of tested ways in which a low-budget demo car could be made to navigate an indoor environment. Canny Edge Detection, Supervised Floor Detection and Imitation Learning were used separately and are contrasted in their effectiveness. The equipment used in this paper approximated an autonomous robot configured to work with a mobile device for image processing. This paper does not provide definitive solutions and simply illustrates the approaches taken to successfully achieve autonomous navigation of indoor environments. The successes and failures of all approaches were recorded and elaborated on to give the reader an insight into the construction of such an autonomous robot.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Indoor navigation with imitation learning using a smartphone as a sensor and controller.
