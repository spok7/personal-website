abstract: This  report  demonstrates  several  methods  used  to make a self-driving vehicle using a supervised learning algorithm and  a  forward-facing  RGBD  camera.  The  project  originally involved   research   in   creating   an   adversarial   attack   on   the vehicleâ€™s  model,  but  due  to  difficulties  with  the  initial  training of  the  car,  the  plans  were  discarded  in  favor  of  completing  the imitation learning portion of the project. Many approaches were explored,  but  due  to  challenges  introduced  by  an  unbalanceddata  set,  the  approaches  had  limited  effectiveness.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Adversarial attacks on supervised self-driving algorithms using RGBD cameras.
